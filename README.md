# strachey-letter
<p>A Python mockup of Christopher Strachey's love letter generator (1952)</p>

<p>I wrote this little mad-lib-like love letter generator a few years ago when I was first learning Python. I was inspired to make it after reading a series on Rhizome called A Queer History of Computing. [Part 3](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/apr/9/queer-history-computing-part-three/) talks about this love letter generator that gay computer scientist Christopher Strachey wrote on the Manchester University Computer in 1952. Strachey met Alan Turing at King's College around this time and Rhizome suggests that Strachey learned how to program this computer because of his connection with Turing.</p>
<p>The letters made by this generator are really ambiguously gendered which is something I love about it. I owe a lot to [this site](http://www.gingerbeardman.com/loveletter/) which I used to get full wordlists for this simple program.</p>
<p>I also made a prettier version on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/67538396/), slightly edited to be a little less salacious...it was kind of a hit which is cool! I'm currently learning how to write web apps so maybe I'll develop this little thing further, we'll see.</p>
